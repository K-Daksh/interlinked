# InterLinked, A peer-to-peer full fledged audio, text and video communication application
I started this project to get a hands on experience of building a full fledged social media application which uses **socket** 
and **WebRTC** to create a fluid and scalable social media application which can handel millions of users at the same time. Due to 
amazing scalability properties of this both APIs, I believe when merged with some future updates (comming soon btw.) it can be a perfect 
social media application with beautiful interface.
